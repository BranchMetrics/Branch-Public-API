The Branch Metrics public API for deferred and contextual mobile deep linking allows you to grow your mobile app with deep links that power referral systems, sharing links and invites with full attribution and analytics.

For complete reference documentation, please go to [Branch's Deep Linking API documentation](https://docs.branch.io/pages/apps/api/).
