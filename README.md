# Branch-Public-API

A public API to tie into for fancy integrations. All endpoints are appended to **https://api.branch.io**

## Creating a Deep Linking URL

For more details on how to create links, see the [Branch link creation guide](https://dev.branch.io/link_creation_guide/)

#### Endpoint

    POST /v1/url
    Content-Type: application/json

#### Parameters

**branch_key** _required_
: The Branch key of the originating app.

##### Functional

**data** _optional_
: The dictionary to embed with the link. Accessed as session or install parameters from the SDK. **Use the data dictionary for all [link control parameters that you'll find here.](https://dev.branch.io/link_configuration/#redirect-customization)**

**alias** _optional_ (max 128 characters)
: Instead of our standard encoded short url, you can specify the alias of the link bnc.lt/alexaustin. Aliases are enforced to be unique per domain (bnc.lt, yourapp.com, etc). Be careful, link aliases are _unique_, immutable objects that cannot be deleted.

NOTE: If you POST to the this endpoint with the same alias, and a matching set of other POST parameters to an existing aliased link, the original will be returned to you. If it clashes and you don't specify a match, will return a HTTP 409 error.

**type** _optional_
: ADVANCED: 
- Set type to 1, to make the URL a one-time use URL. It won't deep link after 1 successful deep link.
- Set type to 2 to make a Marketing URL. These are URLs that are displayed under the Marketing tab on the dashboard.
- *default* is set to 0, which is the standard Branch links created via our SDK.git

**duration** _optional_
: ADVANCED: In seconds. Only set this key if you want to override the match duration for deep link matching. This is the time that Branch allows a click to remain outstanding and be eligible to be matched with a new app session. This is default set to 7200 (2 hours)

##### Tracking

[**Branch analytics parameters**](https://dev.branch.io/link_configuration/#analytics-labels-for-data-organization) _optional_ It's important to tag your links with an organized structure of analytics labels so that the data appears consistent and readable in the dashboard.

**identity**  _optional_ (max 127 characters)
: The identity used to identify the user. If the link is not tied to an identity, there's no need to specify an identity.

#### Returns

```js
  {
    'url': 'http://bnc.lt/l/deeplink-randomID'
  }
```

#### Example

Here's an example cURL that you can paste into the terminal

```sh
curl -X POST \
\
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
\
-d '{"branch_key":"key_live_feebgAAhbH9Tv85H5wLQhpdaefiZv5Dv", "campaign":"new_product_annoucement", "channel":"email", "tags":["monday", "test123"], "data":"{\"name\": \"Alex\", \"email\": \"alex@branch.io\", \"user_id\": \"12346\", \"$deeplink_path\": \"article/jan/123\", \"$desktop_url\": \"https://branch.io\"}"}' \
\
https://api.branch.io/v1/url
```

## Bulk creating Deep Linking URLs

For more details on how to create links, see the [Branch link creation guide](https://dev.branch.io/link_creation_guide/)

#### Endpoint

```sh
  POST /v1/url/bulk/:branch_key
  Content-Type: application/json
```

#### Parameters

A json array of pramameters from [Creating a Deep Linking URL.](https://dev.branch.io/link_creation_guide/) (Note: there is a 100KB limit on the request payload size)

```js
  [
   { 'channel': 'branch' },
   { 'channel': "fb", 'data': '{ "$og_title": "deep linking" }' }
  ]
```

#### Returns

An array of deep linking urls and/or errors in case invalid params.

```js
  [
   { 'url': 'http://bnc.lt/l/deeplink-randomID' },
   { 'error': 'error message' }  // in case of error
  ]
```

## Modifying Existing Deep Linking URLs

We've exposed an endpoint to update a certain category of Branch links through our API. Simply issue a PUT to our v1/url endpoint. Certain links may not be updated, which are /c/ and /d/ links. 

#### Endpoint
```sh
    PUT /v1/url?url=<url>
    Content-Type: application/json
```

#### Parameters

**branch_key** _required_
: The Branch key of the originating app. Found in the Branch Dashboard under **Settings**.

**branch_secret** _required_
: The paired Branch Secret to the Branch Key making the request. Found in the Branch Dashboard under **Settings**.

**url** _required_
: The URL you want to modify, including the host and domain, ex: https://bnc.lt/m/abcd1234, this is included on the URL to request itself:

    PUT https://api.branch.io/v1/url?url=https%3A%2F%2Fbnc.lt%2Ftest

**analytics/tracking parameters** _optional_

: [**Branch analytics parameters**](https://dev.branch.io/link_configuration/#analytics-labels-for-data-organization). Use these keys inside the body of the PUT (NOT inside the 'data' key) to modify data such as channel, campaign, tags, and more.

**data** _optional_

: The dictionary to embed with the link. Accessed as session or install parameters from the SDK. **Use the data dictionary for all [link control parameters that you'll find here.](https://dev.branch.io/link_configuration/#redirect-customization)**

#### Example

If you have a link with a URL of https://bnc.lt/test-link, a *channel* of 'facebook', and *data* of `{ "photo_id" : "50", "valid": "true" }` and want to update the channel, add an extra value to the dictionary, and add a campaign, here's how that would look:

    PUT https://api.branch.io/v1/url?url=https%3A%2F%2Fbnc.lt%2Ftest-link

    {
        "branch_key" : "key_live_xxxx",
        "branch_secret": "secret_live_xxxx",
        "channel": "twitter",
        "campaign": "twitter-november-campaign",
        "data": {
            "photo_id": "51",
            "photo_name": "John Smith",
            "$og_image_url": "https://imgur.com/abcd"
        }
    }

#### Returns

The new link returns existing data of the link plus the newly added data of the link. Following the example above, this is what would return.

```js
{
   "channel": "twitter",
   "campaign": "twitter-november-campaign",
   "feature": "share-button",
   "data": {
       "photo_id": "51",
       "valid": "true",
       "photo_name": "John Smith",
       "$og_image_url": "https://imgur.com/abcd",
       "~id": "123456789",
       "url": "https://bnc.lt/test-link"
   },
   "alias": "test-link",
   "type": 0
}
```

Note, some of this data is existing link data, and some is updated data, but the response will return all data.

#### Restrictions

There are certain restrictions when attempting to update links.
- Not all links are updateable, namely links with the structure of `bnc.lt/c/` or `bnc.lt/d/`.
- You cannot update an alias, e.g. 'https://bnc.lt/test' -> 'https://bnc.lt/test1'.
- You cannot change the identity associated with a Branch link.
- You cannot change the `type` of a link, e.g. a marketing link is type 2, and a standard link generated by our Branch SDK is type 0.
    
## Viewing State of Existing Deep Linking URLs

We've exposed an endpoint to view the contents of Branch links through our API. Simply issue a GET to our v1/url endpoint with the URL you'd like to view.

#### Endpoint
```sh
    GET /v1/url?url=<url>&branch_key=<branch key>
```

#### Parameters

**branch_key** _required_
: The Branch key of the originating app. Found in the Branch Dashboard under **Settings**.

**url** _required_
: The URL you want to modify, including the host and domain, ex: https://bnc.lt/m/abcd1234, this is included on the URL to request itself:

#### Example

If you have a link with a URL of `https://bnc.lt/m/7IhbRIjjmp` with Branch key of key_live_lceUuShIL0u4VHJv8BwEQmaitBfAXqCZ:

    GET https://api.branch.io/v1/url?url=https%3A%2F%2Fbnc.lt%2Fm%2F7IhbRIjjmp&branch_key=key_live_lceUuShIL0u4VHJv8BwEQmaitBfAXqCZ


#### Returns

The new link returns existing data of the link. Following the example above, this is what would return.

```js
{
   "channel": "twitter",
   "campaign": "twitter-november-campaign",
   "feature": "share-button",
   "data": {
       "photo_id": "51",

       "url": "https://bnc.lt/test-link"
   },
   "alias": "test-link",
   "type": 0
}
```


## Structuring a 'dynamic' Deeplink

This should be used for situations where the longer link is okay and you want to create links quickly without a POST to the API. Here's a list of instructions on how to build a deep link: 

1. Start with your Branch domain, http://bnc.lt (or your white labeled one). 
2. Append /a/your_Branch_key.
3. [optional] Append the start of query params '?' 
4. [optional] Append the Branch analytics tag to keep your data organized in the dashboard. ([list here](https://dev.branch.io/link_configuration/#analytics-labels-for-data-organization)) *feature=marketing&channel=email&tags[]=drip1&tags[]=welcome*
5. [optional] Append any custom deep link parameters &user_id=4562&name=Alex&article_id=456
6. [optional] Append your Branch control parameters - see [a full list of them here](https://dev.branch.io/link_configuration/#redirect-customization)

#### Endpoint

```sh
  GET https://bnc.lt/a/<branch_key>?AnyOptionalQueryParamsBelow
```

> Example:
https://bnc.lt/a/key_live_jbgnjxvlhSb6PGH23BhO4hiflcp3y7ky?$deeplink_path=article%2Fjan%2F123&$fallback_url=https%3A%2F%2Fgoogle.com&channel=facebook&feature=affiliate

#### Parameters

For consistency, all parameters are kept in one spot since they are used for everything. Please find them in the [Link Configuration guide](https://dev.branch.io/link_configuration/)
